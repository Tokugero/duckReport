Since 1811, we've delivered high-quality care, conducted pioneering research, educated future leaders and improved the communities we serve.
Each year, Mass General admits more than 48,000 inpatients and handles nearly 1.5 million outpatient visits at its main campus and at its four health centers: in the Back Bay, Charlestown, Chelsea and Revere. Its Emergency Department records nearly 100,000 visits annually. Mass General is the only hospital in the United States to hold concurrent Level 1 verification for adult and pediatric trauma and burn care. The surgical staff performs more than 42,000 operations and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology delivers more than 3,600 babies each year.

Mass General conducts the largest hospital-based research program in the country, with an annual research budget of approximately $786 million. It is the oldest and largest teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, where nearly all Mass General staff physicians serve on the faculty. Mass General is consistently ranked among the nation’s top hospitals by U.S. News and World Report.

In March 1994, the Mass General joined with Brigham and Women's Hospital to form Partners HealthCare System, Inc., an affiliation established to create an integrated health care delivery system providing excellent, cost-effective care while maintaining the hospital's historic dedication to teaching and research. In addition to the founding institutions, Partners HealthCare System now includes McLean Hospital, Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital, North Shore Medical Center, Newton-Wellesley Hospital and Faulkner Hospital.Founded in 1811, Massachusetts General Hospital is the third oldest general hospital in the United States and the oldest and largest in New England.

Boston Children's Hospital is a 395-bed comprehensive center for pediatric health care. As one of the largest pediatric medical centers in the United States, Boston Children's offers a complete range of health care services for children from birth through 21 years of age. (Our Advanced Fetal Care Center can begin interventions at 15 weeks gestation, and in some situations, we treat adults.)

Boston Children's records approximately 24,943 inpatient admissions each year, and our 228 specialized clinical programs schedule more than 557,620 visits annually. Additionally, the hospital performed 26,534 surgical procedures and 158,791 radiological examinations last year.

Boston Children's is home to the world's largest research enterprise based at a pediatric hospital. More than 1,100 scientists, including nine members of the National Academy of Sciences, 11 on-staff members of the Institute of Medicine and 9 members of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, comprise our research community. Current initiatives have attracted a record $225 million in annual funding, including more federal funding than any other pediatric facility.

In the John F. Enders Pediatric Research Laboratories, named for the Boston Children's researcher and Nobel Prize recipient who cultured the polio and measles viruses, hundreds of laboratory researchers and physician investigators search for answers to some of the most perplexing diseases.

In 2003, a generous philanthropic gift made the 295,000 square foot Karp Family Research Laboratories possible. The building increased our research space by more than 60 percent. The Karp family gift is just one of many important gifts that support Boston Children's vital research enterprise.

Through the years, scientists at Boston Children's have set the pace in pediatric research, identifying treatments and therapies for many debilitating diseases, including those of adulthood.
