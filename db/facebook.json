", "description": "The vision of cofounders Dr. Jeffrey Schor and Steven Katz to form PM Pediatrics stemmed from a shared entrepreneurial passion, disillusionment with the healthcare system and a belief that they could make a significant impact in the way acute medical care is delivered to children. The seeds of this partnership were planted years ago when the two were roommates at Amherst College. Jeffrey went on to medical school at New York Medical College, and later completed his residency and fellowship at Children\u2019s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Steven received his MBA from Stanford University and became a management consultant at Bain & Company and then an officer of Kaiser Associates. Eventually, when the former roommates settled down with their young families in the same Long Island town, the vision for PM Pediatrics began to take root.\n\nAs the Director of Pediatric Emergency Medicine and Associate Chair of Emergency Medicine at New York Hospital-Queens (NYHQ), Jeffrey established a distinct emergency department for pediatric patients, grew the number of pediatric emergency visits from 10,000 per year to more than 25,000 and helped grow the entire emergency department to over 100,000 visits. During that same time period, Steven, in his role as management consultant, gained valuable experience in many different facets of the healthcare industry, including medical equipment and supplies, pharmaceuticals and healthcare delivery models. He saw firsthand how the institutional delivery of care was the weakest part of the entire healthcare system.\n\nIn his ten years at NYHQ, Jeffrey recognized that while pediatric patients get far superior medical care from physicians and nurses who are pediatric specialists, a hospital setting comes with many drawbacks in the delivery of that care. The process was inefficient and the environment can be intimidating. Children waited far too long to be seen, stayed longer than necessary and often left dissatisfied. It also was apparent that the majority of pediatric hospital visits were not for life-threatening emergencies. Rather, the problems could easily and safely be managed in an outpatient setting, provided this setting had the right clinicians and was appropriately equipped. But such places did not exist and parents had no alternative to the ER, especially when their pediatrician\u2019s office was closed.\n\nBecause of these frustrations, Jeffrey sought to learn more about the \u201cbusiness\u201d of delivering excellent care, eventually receiving an MBA from NYU Stern School of Business. He also spent many hours discussing his concerns with Steven, who at the time was Managing Director of Strategic Planning and Corporate Development at The Topps Company, Inc., where he was general manager of a successful business that he created. Steven\u2019s entrepreneurial success coupled with Jeffrey\u2019s discouragement with healthcare delivery systems provided fertile ground for that \u201caha\u201d moment: \u201cMaybe we can work together to form a business that can really make an impact on healthcare services for children.\u201d\n\nSteven had the realization that whenever his kids had a serious medical issue and their pediatrician was unavailable, Jeffrey typically provided the care in his house. The Katz family was certainly not unique \u2013 many people in Jeffrey\u2019s community sought his care in order to avoid a trip to the emergency department. This realization, along with Jeffrey\u2019s recognition that most ER visits for children were not true emergencies, made the concept of an \u201coutpatient ER\u201d for children very appealing. Over the next couple of years, the two planned the strategy and operational details of a medical service company dedicated to children and young adults, with convenient hours 365-days a year, as a legitimate alternative to the emergency department. This practice needed to be accessible, welcoming, of the highest quality, and service oriented.

Our correction center was centrally involved in the FDA trials of the excimer laser during the 1990s that eventually led to the approval. During that clinical trial period (1991-1996), the clinic of Joseph Dello Russo, M.D., was the most prominent of the 10 participating clinics, performing more treatments than any of the other study contributors. Additionally, in 1997 we gained FDA approval to conduct unique clinical trials to treat higher degrees of nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism with laser vision correction than had not yet been approved by the FDA.\n\nNot only have they played an integral role in helping to develop, test, and implement the excimer laser nationwide, but the LASIK practice was also involved with the adoption of the Intralase laser technology. Our clinic was the first in the United States to use this new laser, offering all-laser LASIK through Dr. Joseph Dello Russo's pioneering Down-Up LASIK\u2122 technique. Additionally, we were the first practice in the New York area to use Custom Cornea wavefront technology for primary and secondary treatment, and we are pleased to offer this important advance in vision correction to our patients.\n\nWe participate in Medicare, as well as most major insurance programs and vision plans.

There ARE symptoms, unfortunately they may be so subtle that they are attributed to other benign conditions.\n\nThe Ovarian Cancer National Alliance conducted a survey in which 89% of women were unaware of ovarian cancer symptoms before being diagnosed. However, 81% of the respondents realize in hindsight that symptoms existed before diagnosis, with these symptoms being confused with irritable bowel syndrome, pre-menopause, stress, acid reflux, endometriosis, gall bladder issues or other ailments.\nCorrect diagnoses occur only slightly more often than incorrect diagnoses. Only 59% of women are correctly diagnosed, but at least 41% of women are treated for other conditions before being diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n\nThese are scary statistics considering the advances made in early detection and pre-screening tools used to detect other forms of cancer.\n\nIt is time to BREAK THE SILENCE and educate yourself and the women you love!\n\nFACTS:\nThere are NO effective pre-screening tools for ovarian cancer and a pap smear will NOT detect it.\n\nOvarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancers in the United States and is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women.\n\nIn 2016, it is estimated that 22,980 women in the United States will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 14,270 women will die from the disease.\n\nApproximately 174,236 women living in the United States currently have ovarian cancer or have a history of ovarian cancer. Women are usually diagnosed in advanced stages and only 44% survive longer than five years. Only 19% of cases are caught before the cancer has spread beyond the ovary to the pelvic region. Despite aggressive surgical intervention and new chemotherapeutic regimens, the overall 5-year survival rate for women with advanced stage ovarian cancer has remained constant over the past 30 years, at approximately 15%. However, when ovarian cancer is detected and treated early on, the five-year survival rate is greater than 92%.\n\nSYMPTOMS:\nThe symptoms are generally subtle and vague so that women ignore them.The key is that the symptoms last more than 2-3 weeks and are otherwise unexplained. 90% of women with ovarian cancer reported having some of the following symptoms:\n\nIncreasing waist line size, for no obvious reason.\n\nDigestive problems: gas, flatulence, bloating, loss of appetite, occasionally abdominal pain.\n\nAbdominal pressure or discomfort.\n\nChanges in bowel and bladder habits (e.g. urinary frequency, diarrhea, constipation).\n\nPain (less common) in the lower back, pelvis or legs.\n\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding.\n\nUnusual fatigue or backaches.\n\nUnexplained weight loss or gain.\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nSCREENING:\nThere is no effective screening test for ovarian cancer. Screening is not recommended for all women, but is recommended for women with symptoms of ovarian cancer and women at high risk (e.g. women with a family history or women with the BRCA-1 or 2 genetic mutations). However, ovarian abnormalities can often be detected on a routine pelvic exam, with a screening vaginal ultrasound, or with a CA125. Blood levels of CA-125 are elevated in about 50% of women with early ovarian cancer and about 80% of those with advanced disease. The only way to confirm the diagnosis, however, is with an ovarian biopsy.\n\nRISK FACTORS:\nResearchers have identified certain risk factors that increase a woman\u2019s chance of developing ovarian cancer. However, studies also show that most women with these risk factors never develop the disease, while many women who do develop the disease possess no risk factors. The risk factors for ovarian cancer may include:\n\nNever having been pregnant.\n\nIncreased age.\n\nHormone replacement therapy.\n\nFamily or personal history of breast or ovarian cancer. About 7% of ovarian cancer cases have a strong hereditary component. If you have a first degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) with ovarian cancer, your risk of ovarian cancer increases to 5%; if you have 2 first degree relatives with ovarian cancer your risk becomes 7%.\n\nFamily or personal history of BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 genetic mutation. In women with BRCA 1 genetic mutations (and to a lesser extent, BRCA-2), risk of ovarian cancer is 16%\u201344%. These mutations are also associated with earlier onset of the disease. \n\nOther genetic mutations, such as Lynch Syndrome and other\u2019s just being identified.\n\nAbdominal obesity.\n\nWomen who began menstruating before age 12 or reached menopause after age 50.\n\nHaving had breast cancer, particularly before age 50.\n\nFactors that REDUCE ovarian cancer risk:\nChildbearing.\n\nBreastfeeding.\n\nTubal ligation.\n\nSurgical removal of the ovaries AND fallopian tubes.\n\nTaking birth control pills: The Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study (CASH), the largest investigation to date, found an average 40% decrease in the likelihood of ovarian cancer in women who had ever taken birth control pills. The protective effect was observed with as little as 3 to 6 months of use, and persisted for 15 years beyond discontinuation of the pill. Another study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology (8/1/00), found that oral contraceptive pills containing lower doses of estrogen and progestin also cut a woman\u2019s ovarian cancer risk by 40 percent \u2013 the same risk reduction provided by higher dose pills.", "phone": "(508) 827-1212", "id": "278882192167916", "location": {"country": "United States", "zip": "02635", "city": "Cotuit", "state": "MA", "street": "55 Thankful Ln", "latitude": 41.63988, "longitude": -70.43425}}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/storeatooth/", "about": "Learn why storing dental stem cells from your child\u2019s teeth could help protect your family\u2019s health.", "description": "Store-A-Tooth\u2122 (a service of Provia Laboratories) has partnered with dentists across the U.S. since 2006 to inform parents about the opportunity to preserve the valuable mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) found within their children\u2019s baby teeth, wisdom teeth, or teeth removed for orthodontia for use in future potential treatments.

That\u2019s why Mandl School, The College of Allied Health takes an intimate approach to education: unlike other medical colleges, at Mandl School you\u2019ll be a part of a small cohort, meaning individualized attention and more time spent having hands-on experiences.\n\nFounded by New York City biology teacher M.M. Mandl in 1924, this college of medicine was built on the principal that patients receive the best and most efficient care not from a single doctor who is a \"Jack of all trades,\" but from a team of professionals who are knowledgeable in all facets of care, from operating apparatuses to keeping the administrative aspects of an office running as smoothly as possible.\n\nMandl School offers degree and certification programs across the board. Whether your goal is to be a Dental Assistant or Surgical Technologist, Substance Abuse Counselor or Health Care Administrator, you\u2019ll graduate with the training you need for a career that will reward you for years to come.\n\nAnd once you\u2019ve learned the skills you need for your dream job, Mandl School will help you find it. Their professional Career Placement team is ready to find you a job that will propel you into a long and successful career in the medical field.\n\nCentrally located in Midtown Manhattan, just blocks from Central Park, Mandl School is a breeze to get to so that you can focus on your academics instead of stressing about travel. If you\u2019re ready to jumpstart your career with an education from Mandl School, The College of Allied Health, visit them online to learn more about their programs or call the college of medicine at (212) 247-3434 to discuss your future.\n\nMandl is a full supporter of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX).  This amendment prohibits discrimination based on sex in educational programs and activities that receive federal funding.  Title IX protects students, employees, applicants, female, male, gender nonconforming students regardless of their real or perceived sex, gender identity, and/or gender expression, and other persons from any sex-based discrimination, harassment, bullying, or violence including those students who are also pregnant, parenting students, and women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) programs. \n\nThe Title IX Coordinator at Mandl School is the Chief Compliance Officer Maritza E. M. Mercado who has an office located on the 9th floor of 254 W. 54th Street, the office number is 212.247.3434, and the e-mail address is TitleIX@mandl.edu.

Founded by Masha Banar, Board Certified Physician Associate with more than a decade of experience in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, it has been featured on ABC News for its unique alternatives to surgical procedures. \nMasha is a National Educator for Sculptra Aesthetic and teaches facial anatomy and injection techniques to Physicians and Nurses. Her extensive experience combined with artistic background and intuitive appreciation of proportions of the face brings ease to all procedures offered. Our priority is creating a very positive pleasant experience for you in the most private comfortable setting. \nNon-Surgical Facelift \nNon-Surgical Facelift allows you to achieve rested healthy appearance without taking time off your busy life. Masha uses Sculptra collagen stimulator or fillers like Radiesse, Juvederm and Restylane to gently restore youthful contour of the face, conceal depressions under the eyes, soften smile lines and marionette lines, and lift the jowls. Results last up to 2 years. \nNon-Surgical Brow Lift\nExcess skin on upper eyelids and heavy brows can be temporarily lifted with the help of Botox and Dysport. This very quick painless procedure is the most popular at any age and is often combined with treating lines of expression around the eyes, between brows, and forehead. \nNon-Surgical Rhinoplasty (Nose Job)\nThis innovative non invasive procedure made the life-long dreams of many people come true!  After numbing the area Masha injects FDA approved fillers like Radiesse or Restylane to shape and mold the nose, erase bumps, fill in divots, make the nose appear thinner, straighter, more symmetrical, attractive, and in balance with the rest of the face. Our own very unique and special procedure was featured on ABC News.\nNon-Surgical Chin and Jaw augmentation \nReceding or poorly projected chin can make the face and neck appear weak and unattractive. Chin implant can put you at higher risk of infection, numbness, and pain and non-surgical chin and jaw augmentation is a safe alternative. It can make the face more proportional and emphasize masculinity or femininity, based on the size and shape. \nNon-Surgical Jaw Reduction \nAlthough square prominent jawline can be very attractive, in some cases it can put facial features out of balance or make a woman\u2019s face too masculine. It\u2019s very easy to reduce the strength and bulk of the muscles contributing to square jaw appearance with the help of Botox or Dysport injections. \nNon-Surgical Blepharoplasty (Eye Lift)\nDepressions and puffiness under the eyes can make entire face appear tired. Non-surgical blepharoplasty allows keeping trauma and down time to a minimum. It requires injection of Hyaluronic Acid based fillers like Restylane, Perlane, Juvederm, and Belotero under the eyes to conceal the dark circles and tear troughs. \n\nNon-Surgical Lip Augmentation \nMasha first gently anesthetizes the mouth with short acting Lidocaine. She then uses a very advanced technique of enhancing the shape and contour of your lips\u2019 cupid\u2019s bow and vermilion border, then augmenting the volume of the lip itself. This technique ensures the most natural looking and feeling result. \nTMJ/Teeth Grinding Treatment\nThis revolutionary treatment by Masha that has been featured on ABC news has already helped many people to alleviate painful symptoms from teeth clenching and grinding. Very quick painless injection of Botox or Dysport into the largest muscle of the jaw releases the tension and pain within few days.  \nHyperhidrosis (Excessive Sweating) Treatment \nThis often embarrassing clothes- altering condition is easily treated with Botox or Dysport. Results can last up to a year and significantly improve your quality of life. \nBotox/Dysport Treatment of Dynamic Lines\nSoftening the appearance of lines of expression has been around for decades and proved to be safe efficient way of looking instantly younger and less worried. Product is injected around the eyes, forehead and brows to achieve rested lifted look. Results last from three to several months based on the dose and initial frequency of treatments. Some activity like exercise, laying face down, facial or massage should be avoided within 24 hours after the procedure. \n\u2022\tVisage (French vis-  face + -age -age):  the face, usually with reference to shape, features, and expression \n\n\u2022\tAvoiding blood thinners like Aspirin, Advil, Motrin, Fish Oil and Flaxseed Oil 2 weeks prior and taking Arnica by mouth a week before procedure significantly lowers the risk of bruising and swelling. \n", "phone": "(617) 795-0201", "id": "214350522074513", "location": {"country": "United States", "zip": "02458", "city": "Newton", "state": "MA", "street": "31 Channing St", "latitude": 42.357105, "longitude": -71.187881}}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/ColbertMD/", "about": "Through years of research, development & the effectiveness of his signature Triad facial, Dr. Colbert presents his breakthrough skincare line, Colbert MD.", "description": "Breakthrough clinical Skincare line, developed by board-certified Dermatologis Dr. David Colbert", "phone": "(917) 979-4411", "id": "955827621101485", "location": {"country": "United States", "city": "New York", "state": "NY", "street": "119 5th Ave", "latitude": 40.73915, "longitude": -73.99113}}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/BenjaminInstitute/", "about": "The Benjamin Institute is the international online center for instant, quality, convenient and affordable continuing education from leading massage therapy experts.

The fact they inform you that they \"accept\" your cover is not always sufficient and you could find yourself out of pocket with a \"balance bill\".\n \nFor example:\n\nYou attend a health provider who has informed you that they \"accept\", \"take\" or \"will work with\" your Insurance Provider. It later transpires that they are not In Network Participating and you later receive their bill, for lets say $500.\n\nWhen you contact your Insurance Provider to cover the costs, they could inform you that the practitioner is not In Network Participating and that they only allow a \"contracted sum\" of $200 for that particular treatment by a medical provider who is NOT In Network Participating.\n\nRESULT: YOU ARE BALANCE BILLED FOR $300 - OUCH!\n \nYou need to be extremely careful that this does not happen to you.\n \nCategories of Medical Providers:\n\nDoctor - Pain Doctor - Orthopaedic Doctor - Podiatrist - Physician - Psychiatrist - Physical Therapist - Urologist - Cardiologist - Paediatrician - Neurologist - Optometrist - Obstetrician - Oncologist - Nephrologist - Rheumatologist - Dermatologist - Endocrinologist - Gastrologist - Chiropractor - Surgery Center - Surgical Center\n  \nCall us to receive expert Physical Therapy Treatment, safe in the knowledge that you will never be unwittingly \"balance billed\".\n \nABC Physical Therapy - 50 South Bridge Street - Somerville.

I believe in Freedom of Speech.  \n=============================================\nVery Important News: If you call a medical provider, Doctor, Pain Doctor, Orthopedic Doctor, Podiatrist, Physician, Psychiatrist, Physical Therapist, Urologist, Cardiologist, Pediatrician, Neurologist, Optometrist, Obstetrician, Oncologist, Nephrologist, Rheumatologist, Dermatologist, Endocrinologist, Gastrologist, Chiropractor, because you need help & want to make an appointment to see them & they say the words on the phone we \u201cACCEPT\u201d or take or will work with your health insurance or accept your insurance plan that \u201cDoes Not\u201d necessarily mean the medical provider participates and is In Network with your health insurance plan so you can end up getting balanced billed after receiving medical care from them if the medical provider you went to does not \u201cparticipate\u201d with your health insurance plan. \n\nFor an example to help you understand this, if you went to the medical provider & they charged $500 (or $1000 or more depending on if you went to a specialist) for your visit to them then your insurance company paid the medical provider $100 saying the words reasonable & customary (contracted rate) for that medical visit is only worth $100 but the medical provider charged $500 (or more) then the medical provider can send you a bill for $400 (balance bill you) because the medical provider did not have a contract with your insurance company & did not participate with them so you went to a out of network non participating medical provider & now you owe $400 or more. Your insurance company pays out your contracted rates (fixed fee schedule) that you have a contract with.\n\nVery important updated news: if you need surgery & your Doctor tells you to go to a Surgery Center instead of a hospital for surgery always \u201cCALL\u201d your health insurance company to \u201cVERIFY\u201c that the \u201cSURGERY CENTER\u201d is In Network \u201cPARTICIPATING\u201d with your health insurance plan or you might get balanced billed if the surgery center does NOT PARTICIPATE with your health insurance plan. \n\nAlso if you use your out of network benefits and your insurance plans says they pay 80 percent of reasonable charges per your plan limit (contracted rate your insurance plan will pay) and your medical provider charges $1000.00 but your insurance company says reasonable & customary for your medical visit is only worth (contracted amount) $400 for an example then your insurance company will only send your medical provider 80 percent of $400 so you will still owe the balance due of the $1000 bill and if you have surgery it could be in the thousands. To be financially safe always CALL your insurance company to \u201cverify\u201d that whatever medical provider you are going to see Participates\u201d with your health insurance plan, and at your appointment verify the medical provider taking care of you is the person that your insurance company told you was \u201cParticipating\u201d with your insurance plan. \n\nAt ABC Physical Therapy we are here to help you.

She quickly became a \"rock junkie\" and began learning crystal healing. \nToday, Heather sits very happily in her store and is helping people choose the right stone for themselves and their circumstances in life; she believes that the earth elements that make up crystals and minerals are like taking vitamins. She works very well helping people one on one, and loves to have conversations about the emotions that make up humans and assisting with the healing process. She believes that there is a lovely balance of science and faith that comes with crystal healing and manifesting. Even if you don't need or believe in stone healing, one cannot deny their beauty.

Their physicians and lymphedema therapists recommended a compression sleeve as the most effective way of controlling the swelling. When they researched the options for the sleeve they found that the only ones available were rough textured, heavy, hot, beige, and bandage-like. Frustrated and dismayed over the lack of options they had for compression sleeves, Robin and Rachel met with Kristin Dudley, a fashion designer, to discuss their idea of creating a more elegant and comfortable compression sleeve.\n\nIn late 2007, Robin left the company. Soon after, Rachel discovered her breast cancer had returned. While she was being treated, she continued building LympheDIVAs, which brought her much joy during a difficult time in her life. Rachel died January 22, 2008, at the age of 37. Her determination and compassion to improve the lives of breast cancer survivors is very much ingrained in the spirit of LympheDIVAs.\n\nToday, LympheDIVAs\u2019 products can be found in retail locations nationwide and internationally. At Rachel\u2019s request, her father Dr. Howard Levin and her mother, Judy Levin took over the responsibility of running the company which their daughter helped found. In August of 2010, Rachel\u2019s little brother, Josh Levin, joined the company and is now running it with his parents.

", "description": "\nSubstance Abuse Treatment and Counseling for Young Adults\n \nSOBA College Recovery\u2019s specific motivation is to help those in a community setting who may have a problem with substance abuse or other mental disorders commonly associated with substance abuse. At each phase of treatment clients receive certain levels of care, with a gradual step-down process proven most effective for recovering adults in this phase of their lives. When enough trust is built, clients are stepped-down from their level of controlled supervision and given more responsibility and privilege. Throughout treatment, our clients are to receive personalized attention and therapeutic care for addiction and the underlying co-occurring disorders associated with drug abuse and mental health issues. The simple idea is that the more a client works through the program the more they become self-sufficient and learn to care more about their actions and take responsibility for their own futures.\n \nHow our Young Adult Program Works\n\nDuring the initial phase of our program we teach our clients how to become characters of action and focus on undertaking many simple daily tasks such as cleanliness, personal hygiene, and physical health. Our team of case managers assist every step of the way providing the needed planning, communication and guidance to help take care of any outstanding issues outside the program that stand in the way of their recovery process. These are essential steps in order to start living a healthy sober lifestyle. They help to ease anxiety and restore order in daily life. The preliminary phase of our program focuses on peer to peer relationship building and making healthy lifestyle choices a part of sober life. All of these lifestyle changes begin immediately upon admission, and in conjunction with extensive evaluation, treatment plan development and assessment of individual needs, each client is given the best opportunity to start to respect themselves and the people around them in order to move forward and grow toward success.\n \nWhen Clients have successfully shown that the can demonstrate the values necessary to move onto the next phase of treatment, they are simultaneously given more responsibility for themselves, and less restriction of their time. On this phase of treatment clients will begin to re-enter society and school. At this point, clients begin to attain and build confidence and future goals while still actively practicing the principles from the previous phase of treatment. This gives each individual a defined incentive to take advantage of new opportunities for work and education. It is in this phase that case managers begin to assist clients with resume construction, job interview training and educational enrollment assistance for those looking to move forward toward stability and financial independence.\n \nAfter successfully completing the first two phases of treatment clients are then stepped down to the lowest level of treatment, where clients have minimal daily requirements and become even more self-sufficient. Many of our clients pursue both education and employment simultaneously, but each individual is given the best resources to help them follow their path toward future success, one day at a time. Clients also begin to start developing relationships outside of the program in 12 step meetings, taking active roles in the recovery community, and defining themselves as leaders of their peer group.\n", "phone": "(732) 847-2870", "id": "1453225011596938", "location": {"country": "United States", "zip": "08901", "city": "New Brunswick", "state": "NJ", "street": "104 Bayard St", "latitude": 40.493534, "longitude": -74.447586}}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/DecisionNutrition/", "about": "Have YOU made a good decision today?  www.decisionnutrition.com", "description": "The HD Diet: Achieve Lifelong Weight Loss with Chia Seeds and Other Hydrophilic Foods\n", "phone": "(516) 939-9090", "id": "633338393354870", "location": {"country": "United States", "zip": "11023", "city": "Great Neck", "state": "NY", "street": "310 E Shore Road Suite 301", "latitude": 40.80024, "longitude": -73.7139399}}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/SunspireHealth/", "about": "Sunspire Health is a national network of addiction treatment providers offering a full continuum of care.

Not only does losing a tooth affect your smile, it also changes the shape of your face causing you to look prematurely aged.\n\nMany people who have conventional dentures don\u2019t like to wear them because they don\u2019t stay in place. TeethXpress offers a way to keep dentures secure and allows you to go about your daily life with confidence.\n\nConventional dentures are designed to give you the appearance of natural teeth, but not actually replace your natural teeth. You may have noticed that your denture that once fit well now slips constantly and requires costly visits to the dentist for adjustment. That\u2019s because every day that you wear a denture the bone in your jaw shrinks a little more. Eventually the denture won\u2019t fit at all and you will have to replace it.\n\nTeethXpress is a very different solution. You will still have beautiful natural looking teeth, but now they will also function like natural teeth. The TeethXpress solution secures your denture to surgically placed dental implants so that you can eat, speak and live confidently without the fear of slipping dentures.\nFrank C Perry DDS DICOI\nDiplomate International Congress of Oral Implanvology\n\n\nFrank C Perry DDS is a member and a diplomate in the international congress of oral implantology.\nThe International Congress of Oral Implantologists (ICOI) was founded in 1972.

Jin Shin Jyutsu was rediscovered by Master Jiro Murai of Japan. Murai devoted his life to the study, research and teaching of JSJ. Mary Burmeister was Murai's student and after studying with him for 8 years in Japan, she brought JSJ home with her to the US. She continued her studies with Murai by mail. Pamela Markarian Smith was Mary's student since 1965. She studied extensively with Mary and teaching follow up classes after Mary taught  official \"5 day classes\" and students asked to have more detailed explanation and continued study. Mary's classes were growing and it was time to have the next generation of new instructors follow in her footsteps.\nPamela Smith, Philomena Dooley, Muriel Carlton and Wayne Hackett were chosen as the new group of teachers. David Burmeister, Mary's son would head the organization. It soon became clear that Pamela would not be able to work with the new organization, JSJ Inc. As Pamela was Mary's oldest student, she was given permission to continue the work on her own. Pamela formed the Jin Shin Institute.\n\nPamela trained many students over the years in the art of Jin Shin. She created a set of textbooks, a DVD series of the 5 day class and 2 posters that basically represents the whole philosophy and usage of Jin Shin in a nutshell. It is clear that Pamela's work comes from a place of integrity and deep love for Mary Burmeister and the art of JSJ. \n\nMyself, Alexis Brink, came to JSJ in 1991. Philomena Dooley has been my mentor and teacher for all these years. I have been practicing, teaching Self Help, hosting study- and mentoring groups from my center \"JSJNY\" in New York City. I also introduced JSJ in my native country Holland and translated Mary's textbooks.My commitment and passion for JSJ and my inability to grow in the JSJ organization led me to Pamela and Jin Shin Institute.\n\nWhen I first looked at Pamela's materials I realized what a deep understanding this protege of Mary's has of the material and It became my mission to meet with her. When I walked into her house in Santa Rosa there clearly was an instant connexion between us. We spend the next 2 days talking and she was so willing to share all with me.\n\nPamela and I have have the same intention; to give Jin Shin Jyustu the place that it deserves in the world and spread it so that everybody can benefit from this amazingly powerful energy medicine. Pamela's creation of a great body of work through Jin Shin Institute will be the foundation for different avenues to introduce Jin Shin to a larger audience in the world then it currently is.\n\nAs Pamela at this point in her life, would like to take more of a backseat and watch her flower bloom, I will be actively participating in growing Jin Shin Institute with the guidance of Pamela and her partner Maggie.

Our courses are peer-reviewed, accredited, approved or endorsed by more than a dozen of the leading national health care associations.\n\nDr. Blake Andersen, CEO and founder of the HealthSciences Institute states, \u201cWe share with the National Institute of Whole Health, a vision for rigorous standards of training and practice for health care practitioners who work in a health care environment where chronic, not acute, conditions, are the main threats to health and independence. These standards are patient-centered and transcend professional disciplines and care settings. They should be based on proficiency, evidence and outcomes. They should also carry the endorsement of the healthcare industry.\u201d\n\nThe NIWH Whole Health professional programs were created to serve those who serve others in health care.

In 2015, CMU has completed a Blue Cross/Blue Shield funded study on the NIWH model. In 2016, Michigan State University Medical Center will begin a registered clinical trial on the Whole Health Education Behavioral Engagement model, and its potential to transform the staggering problems healthcare faces due to poor communication between patients and providers.\n\nWhole Health Education with Behavioral Engagement places the patient at the center of their health care and empowers them, with a demystified understanding of health and disease, to take  control over their health and longevity. Whole Health Education\u00ae with Behavioral Engagement\u2122, is the first known patient education and health behavior change model developed, tested and utilized in clinical settings. The model encourages and supports both self-directed and shared decision making between patients, their physicians and care givers to create the best possible health outcomes.\n\nThe tireless work of NIWH has been recognized as important and visionary. This work includes the developed of a Whole Person Care \u2122 model of training for nurses and medical providers, as well as the Behavioral Engagement \u2122 communication skill set.\n\nIn 2005, the NIWH model became the mandate for \u201cthe practice of medicine in all settings\u201d.\nBoth the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO \u2013 now called the Joint Commission) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) identified these key guidelines, which include:\n\n> placing patients at the center of their health care decision making\n> treating the patient as a whole person\n> evidenced-based health education for prevention and disease management\n\nMedicaid/Medicare initiatives, include patient education, prevention of disease states and \u201cPay for Performance\u201d reimbursement guidelines for medical practices.\u201dPay for Performance\u201d reimbursements are based on a physician\u2019s documentation of patient education methods and disease prevention outcomes data.", "phone": "(888) 354-4325", "id": "10153211574972469", "location": {"country": "United States", "zip": "02482", "city": "Wellesley", "state": "MA", "street": "148 Linden St, Ste 208a", "latitude": 42.2992287, "longitude": -71.2939987}}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/essentialoildailywithsarah/", "about": "Let me help you with your wellness by teaching you about doTERRA essential oils.

In August 2004 she lost most of her eyesight to a rare disease that causes abrupt blindness - Leber\u2019s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). The damage to Vicky's eyesight was thought to be irreversible and she was diagnosed to become completely blind. Vicky has always lived an extremely healthy lifestyle, and instead of accepting her diagnosis she set her own course for recovery through good nutrition, exercise, and plenty of faith. In a development that confounded doctors, Vicky regained much of her sight and it continues to improve today.\n\nAs a result of her journey Vicky opened a health and fitness studio called Studio V Health in Colts Neck, NJ, to share her passion for natural, healthy living. In 2010, with the help of her son and fellow health nut Ray DeRosa, this studio morphed into an \u201conline health club\u201d to make it fun and easy for absolutely anyone, anywhere, to live healthy: V Well Health.\n\nFollow Us:\nvwellhealth.com\ntwitter.com/vickyvwell\ninstagram.com/vwellhealth\npinterest.com/vwellhealth\nCheck out Vicky's blog at http://thekitchenheals.com/", "location": {"country": "United States", "zip": "10016", "city": "New York", "state": "NY", "street": "261  Madison Ave", "latitude": 40.75054, "longitude": -73.98076}, "id": "483293835079465"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/ComfortKeepersofCTShoreline/", "about": "Comfort Keepers is a non-medical home care agency that provides homemaking, companion/personal care, and incidental transportation.

We travel the world and attend seminars and exhibitions to complete our inventory. Quality, uniqueness in design, and exclusivity are our primary criteria when choosing a new collection. Material and workmanship are the basis of good product. Our focus is on the best source of metal and plastic frames. The use of titanium material in eyewear has revolutionized the industry. Titanium is strong, hypoallergenic, and lightweight. Our primary sources of titanium eyewear are Japan based manufacturers that surpass most of their European competitors. Our plastic frames are primarily produced from Italian Mazzucchelli zyl. Mazzucchelli creates some of the best textures and colors for eyewear. \n\n     Ingenuity and uniqueness in design are critical aspects of high-end eyewear. Clean and delicate soldering, multi-layer color laminations, laser engraving, and screw free construction are examples of such elaborate details. These factors greatly influence our decision when selecting a collection. For example, Bevel spectacle collection utilizes milled and beta titanium forming extremely unique, two tone color and sculpting. The elaborate colors are hand selected to capture design and fashion. The Lindberg collection is another great example of ingenuity and detail. All the metal frames in the collection utilize a patented screw less titanium design. Visit our store to explore the endless possibilities.\n\n     Eyewear is perhaps the most important accessory in our daily life. Choosing the proper eyewear for an individual may seem simple, but once attempted you will find it can benefit from expert hands. We consider opticianing to be an art form.

I am passionate about essential oils, let me show you why!", "description": "My name is Kim Jeffery and I live in North Attleboro, MA.  I'm married and a proud mom of 3 amazing kids.  I spent the beginning of my career in the hospitality industry and worked for a hotel franchise for 15+ years.  It got to be a very hectic and demanding job which took me away from my family for days at a time.  \n\nIn 2012 I did so some soul searching and re-prioritized what was important in my life.  Being there for my kids after school and being able to help out in school was more important than a big job with a big title.  So I walked away from it all, the six figure income and all it's perks!  \n\nI wasn't quite sure what I wanted to be when I grew up, but eventually I guess you could say it found me.  I was on a business trip with my husband in CA when I walked into a retail store called bath junkie.  I knew right away this was what I wanted to do.  That was in March of 2012, I opened my store in my home town in Oct 2012.\n\nLet me tell you I probably wasn't completely prepared for what lay ahead and I went through all the trials and tribulations of setting up and running a business.  I went through good times and bad always learning and pressing on.\n\nThis past November 2015 I was starting to integrate more natural and organic products into my store which led me to discover doTERRA oils and the company itself.  It's funny how the universe has a way of aligning itself just at the right time for I truly believe that I was meant to discover essential oils through my store and begin a new chapter in my life.\n\nYes I still have my retail store but my passion has propelled me in a new direction of educatging and sharing essential oils.  I believe that my 3+ years running my retail store have prepared me to launch my new venture and I hope you'll come along with me.\n\nWhile I'm not a doctor and can't diagnose illnesses I can share my personal experiences with the oils and my knowledge of doTERRA.  It's up to you to discover how serious you are about making healthier life decisions for you and your family.

In the same, the hospital was ordered to award a \"whistleblower\" $2.1 million for being fired.According to a study conducted by National Nurses United and released in January 2014, the hospital was the 9th most expensive in the state, charging 763% above costs.Bayonne Medical Center entered the national spotlight again in 2014, when an investigative news team at NBC 4 New York reported that the hospital charged a New Jersey teacher nearly $9,000 USD to bandage his middle finger.

MHMC is an acute care, 230-bed hospital located between the shores of the Hackensack River overlooking the wildlife preserves of the Meadowlands, and the NYC skyline. Nestled between the high-tech NYC skyline and the nature of the Meadowlands is where MHMC envisions itself. Patients will receive the tender, loving care of family in the most sophisticated high-tech surroundings.\n\nIn December 2010, a group of investors called MHA purchased the hospital with the commitment to develop it into one of the most respected and technologically advanced healthcare facilities along the Eastern seaboard. As part of that commitment, MHA, LLC has re-designed the patient experience at MHMC. Through many new developments, both monumental and what others may call small, the new management has created a hospital rich in innovation and outstanding in service. We have recently been dubbed \u201cNew Jersey\u2019s best kept secret.\u201d\n\nDuring these past months, millions and millions of dollars have been spent on updating the physical facility, hiring the best specialists in the country, and bringing in the newest, state-of-the-art equipment. We are also paperless for a totally streamlined process providing the ultimate security in patient safety AND reducing our carbon footprint on the environment.\n\nEvery patient room at Meadowlands Hospital is a private room, many with sweeping views of the beautiful natural surroundings, others looking out to the majestic New York City skyline. A private room is the most effective way to eliminate the spread of infection. In addition, we understand the importance of privacy when a patient is not feeling well or recuperating from a procedure. We also offer FREE TV, Phone service, Internet and unlimited 24/7 visiting hours.\n\nAdditionally, MHMC is also exceptionally clean \u2013 our Housekeeping staff has earned us the reputation as one of the Top 5 Cleanest Hospitals in New Jersey. With our ever-expanding Outpatient Physician\u2019s Center, we are now able to provide specialized care in one convenient location.\n\nOur Radiology equipment is second to none. In fact, we are now home to the M.E.G. (Magneto Encephalograpy system) \u2013 there are only 4 in the world, a 3Tesla GE Magnetic Resonance Imaging machine (MRI) and, for our claustrophic patients \u2013 an Open MRI.\n\nNew programs are popping up every week. We now offer a House Call service for elderly, homebound and disable patients. Our Center for Neuroscience is making groundbreaking results in their care of patients with traumatic brain injuries and neurological disorders. Our Emergency Department now sees patients within a 45 minute time period \u2013 no more long hours sitting in the ER waiting room.\n\nBut it\u2019s the people here at Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center that makes the real difference. Our staff is truly our crowning glory. From our experienced, progressive administration, to our board-certified, highly skilled physicians, to our caring and compassionate expert nursing staff, our professionals are the very heartbeat of MHMC. Our patients let us know how much they appreciate the remarkable care they have received. See for yourself \u2013 read our Patients\u2019 Stories.\n\nMHMC is accredited by DNV, the American College of Surgeons for Cancer Care, the American Diabetes Association, the College of American Pathologists, the American Association of Blood Banks, the American College of Radiology and the Medical Society of New Jersey. Memberships include the American Hospital Association, the New Jersey Hospital Association, and the Hudson Perinatal Consortium.

At Damien Fertility Partners, our laboratory received zero deficiencies from all of these certifying organizations. We strive to have the best laboratory so we can increase your chances of success.\n\nThis is an exciting time of growth and change for our practice. After twenty years of caring for patients in our Little Silver office we are thrilled to have opened a new treatment facility in Shrewsbury. \n\nOur entire team has collaborated to customize our new facility so we can continue to offer our patients exceptional care.

He then enlisted in the army and served as captain from 1968-1970. After two years of specialty training at Eastman Dental Center in Rochester, NY, he became a Pediatric Dentist in 1972 and started his private practice in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nHe immediately began studying orthodontics and became an expert in the growth and development of children and incorporated this knowledge into Pediatric Orthodontics for his patients. He began teaching and lecturing at the College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey for fifteen years with the title of Associate Professor. Early on he realized that when he gave a young boy or girl a great smile through orthodontics, almost every child had wonderful changes in their self-esteem and self-image. They did better in school, enhanced their relationships, increased their popularity and even improved family behavior.\r\n\r\nOver the years, many of the parents of his orthodontic patients were so thrilled with the results Dr. Lagstein was creating for their children they asked him to help them as well. Before long, Dr. Lagstein began performing orthodontics on adults.\r\nHowever, Dr. Lagstein found adult orthodontics to be frustrating and unfulfilling. Adults took longer than children to complete and often got burnt out and regretted their decision to straighten their teeth. He found it so unsatisfying that he finally stopped doing adults completely\u2026until he discovered a new technology.\r\n\r\nThis technology allowed adults teeth to be straightened much more quickly than the traditional techniques. Dr. Lagstein traveled and studied this new method intensely, then combined this technology with his vast experience in Pediatric Dentistry and came up with \u201cStraight Teeth in Six Months\u201d for adults. His adult patient base increased rapidly and he opened a second office in New York City. As he completed more and more adult cases, Lagstein was surprised to discover that adults had even more remarkable life transformations than children or teenagers once they were proud of their smile. He found patient after patient experiencing profound life changes in their jobs, relationships & marriages.\r\n\r\nOnce he realized that he was doing significantly more than straightening adults\u2019 teeth, he decided to author a book entitledBrace Yourself For Success. It tells countless stories of life transformations from adults who were once embarrassed by their smile then went through the six month technology and experienced a dramatic reversal!\r\n\r\nDr. Lagstein made it his mission to help as many people as he can realize their dreams by giving them the smile they always wanted in a short time without pain, embarrassment or sacrifice.\r\n\r\nDr. Lagstein presently lives in New Jersey with his wife Wendy and 3 year old daughter Fara. He has three grown children\u2014Lisa, David and Eric who are scattered across the east coast, but find their way home frequently for great family times.\r\nLagstein has successfully completed more than 30 marathons was nominated as a torch bearer for the Salt Lake City Olympics and carried the torch through New York City. He leads a life committed to total health and applies that same dedication to the health and well-being of his clients and patients. After 34 years of private practice, Dr. Lagstein\u2019s passion remains the same\u2014raising the self-esteem of his patients.

However, we lose it just by living life often polluted by Ignorance. It is possible to get to this Peaceful state through the Stillness of the mind by doing things that bring us Joy. Ancient tools like Pranayama, Meditation and such practices help tremendously in achieving this True nature of our Soul.\n\nAbout this page...\nKnowing that mind can be expansive, this page presents collaborated efforts of peaceful states of minds of many Artists across the world. Ideally we all would like to have this state eternally. However, that journey is a work in progress for most of us. In the meanwhile we hope to hold on to the thoughts and images that have been captured in that very peaceful or peace seeking state of minds of the participating Artists .These Artists have worked independently in capturing the essence simply by being in harmony with Nature.  Stillness Power further put words out there capturing the thoughts that come to mind in the moment when the image captured by an artist is viewed. It is for most part a very meditative process. It is very possible that the Artist capturing the image could have had a different thought or perspective in mind. Nevertheless it is interesting to see which thought comes to the top of the stack of the mind when the image is viewed. This whole process can be very liberating, therapeutically as well spiritually for all people involved including the final audience, mainly FANs like you.  In the end it allows us to take that journey to go deeper into your Soul, our True Being. So be inspired by the Creation, Imagination, Experience and Connections we all make here at this page.

One day, around 7pm, his 3-year-old child was injured while jumping on the bed at home. The child bumped his head on the edge of the bed and suffered swelling, along with black and blue discoloration near his eye. The parents immediately called their pediatrician\u2019s office, only to be greeted by the answering service that directed them to the emergency room.\nNot knowing where else to go, they took their child to the emergency room. Once they arrived, they were placed in a line that was made unbearably long thanks to flu season. While the child was immediately triaged, they were told they would have to wait to see a doctor since the child\u2019s injuries were not life-threatening. After four hours of waiting, their child was seen for ten minutes by a pediatrician in the emergency room. They were advised that the injury was not life-threatening, that the child\u2019s eye was safe and that they could provide the child with a pain reliever and some other simple remedies. If they had only been told this information four hours prior, they would have been able to alleviate their child\u2019s discomfort sooner. They also would not have had to endure the agony of waiting in the emergency room with a roomful of unhappy children that also looked like they did not need to be there. But, unfortunately, their parents didn\u2019t have any other options.\nAfter that terrible experience, the father (and co-founder) thought back to two other instances where their son, as an infant, was taken to the emergency room because of a high-fever and the ER sent them home after performing a routine check-up. The co-founder realized the need for a comfortable, child-friendly alternative to the emergency room for children with non life-threatening conditions and decided to create Kinder Pediatric.\n", "phone": "(732) 709-7111", "id": "209614625829500", "location": {"country": "United States", "zip": "08830", "city": "Iselin", "state": "NJ", "street": "530 Green St", "latitude": 40.562308315218, "longitude": -74.29865761348}}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/Grace-Dental-137597436278577/", "about": "Your smile.

However, a proper understanding of the givens of human nature could change all that.\nAddiction spreads to every kind of pleasurable behaviour: drinking, surfing (wave and internet), sex, food, and so on. Some activities or substances can generate a feeling that is so powerful that life without that feeling may never seem worthwhile again. For example, many gamblers have a big win early in their career and then spend the rest of their life chasing that buzz.\n\nMy first consideration will always be the confidentiality of our client therapist relationship, your welfare, safety and comfort. Your treatment session will be, first and foremost, unique to you and will begin the process whereby you start to re-frame the problem and to circumvent whatever blockages are preventing you from leading a normal and happy life.\n\nOvercome - Drug addictions - Cocaine, Cannabis\u2026, Smoking, Gambling, Excessive  Alcohol Consumption, Emotional Eating.\nRemove - Anxiety, Phobias, Fears,  Depression, Low Self Esteem, Stress, Social Anxiety, Blushing, Shyness and Nervousness.\nEnjoy - Deep, Restful Rejuvenating Sleep, Increased Energy, Self Control and Freedom  \nBecome - More Confident, Happier, Self Assured.\nDevelop new relationships with Food, Lose Weight, Look Great, Fitter and Healthier.\nThis is my day job, it\u2019s what I do, it\u2019s who I am and I live for it.\n\nI will deliver the best possible outcome for you.
