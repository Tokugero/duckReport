There ARE symptoms, unfortunately they may be so subtle that they are attributed to other benign conditions.\n\nThe Ovarian Cancer National Alliance conducted a survey in which 89% of women were unaware of ovarian cancer symptoms before being diagnosed. However, 81% of the respondents realize in hindsight that symptoms existed before diagnosis, with these symptoms being confused with irritable bowel syndrome, pre-menopause, stress, acid reflux, endometriosis, gall bladder issues or other ailments.\nCorrect diagnoses occur only slightly more often than incorrect diagnoses. Only 59% of women are correctly diagnosed, but at least 41% of women are treated for other conditions before being diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n\nThese are scary statistics considering the advances made in early detection and pre-screening tools used to detect other forms of cancer.\n\nIt is time to BREAK THE SILENCE and educate yourself and the women you love!\n\nFACTS:\nThere are NO effective pre-screening tools for ovarian cancer and a pap smear will NOT detect it.\n\nOvarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancers in the United States and is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women.\n\nIn 2016, it is estimated that 22,980 women in the United States will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 14,270 women will die from the disease.\n\nApproximately 174,236 women living in the United States currently have ovarian cancer or have a history of ovarian cancer. Women are usually diagnosed in advanced stages and only 44% survive longer than five years. Only 19% of cases are caught before the cancer has spread beyond the ovary to the pelvic region. Despite aggressive surgical intervention and new chemotherapeutic regimens, the overall 5-year survival rate for women with advanced stage ovarian cancer has remained constant over the past 30 years, at approximately 15%. However, when ovarian cancer is detected and treated early on, the five-year survival rate is greater than 92%.\n\nSYMPTOMS:\nThe symptoms are generally subtle and vague so that women ignore them.The key is that the symptoms last more than 2-3 weeks and are otherwise unexplained. 90% of women with ovarian cancer reported having some of the following symptoms:\n\nIncreasing waist line size, for no obvious reason.\n\nDigestive problems: gas, flatulence, bloating, loss of appetite, occasionally abdominal pain.\n\nAbdominal pressure or discomfort.\n\nChanges in bowel and bladder habits (e.g. urinary frequency, diarrhea, constipation).\n\nPain (less common) in the lower back, pelvis or legs.\n\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding.\n\nUnusual fatigue or backaches.\n\nUnexplained weight loss or gain.\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nSCREENING:\nThere is no effective screening test for ovarian cancer. Screening is not recommended for all women, but is recommended for women with symptoms of ovarian cancer and women at high risk (e.g. women with a family history or women with the BRCA-1 or 2 genetic mutations). However, ovarian abnormalities can often be detected on a routine pelvic exam, with a screening vaginal ultrasound, or with a CA125. Blood levels of CA-125 are elevated in about 50% of women with early ovarian cancer and about 80% of those with advanced disease. The only way to confirm the diagnosis, however, is with an ovarian biopsy.\n\nRISK FACTORS:\nResearchers have identified certain risk factors that increase a woman\u2019s chance of developing ovarian cancer. However, studies also show that most women with these risk factors never develop the disease, while many women who do develop the disease possess no risk factors. The risk factors for ovarian cancer may include:\n\nNever having been pregnant.\n\nIncreased age.\n\nHormone replacement therapy.\n\nFamily or personal history of breast or ovarian cancer. About 7% of ovarian cancer cases have a strong hereditary component. If you have a first degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) with ovarian cancer, your risk of ovarian cancer increases to 5%; if you have 2 first degree relatives with ovarian cancer your risk becomes 7%.\n\nFamily or personal history of BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 genetic mutation. In women with BRCA 1 genetic mutations (and to a lesser extent, BRCA-2), risk of ovarian cancer is 16%\u201344%. These mutations are also associated with earlier onset of the disease. \n\nOther genetic mutations, such as Lynch Syndrome and other\u2019s just being identified.\n\nAbdominal obesity.\n\nWomen who began menstruating before age 12 or reached menopause after age 50.\n\nHaving had breast cancer, particularly before age 50.\n\nFactors that REDUCE ovarian cancer risk:\nChildbearing.\n\nBreastfeeding.\n\nTubal ligation.\n\nSurgical removal of the ovaries AND fallopian tubes.\n\nTaking birth control pills: The Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study (CASH), the largest investigation to date, found an average 40% decrease in the likelihood of ovarian cancer in women who had ever taken birth control pills. The protective effect was observed with as little as 3 to 6 months of use, and persisted for 15 years beyond discontinuation of the pill. Another study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology (8/1/00), found that oral contraceptive pills containing lower doses of estrogen and progestin also cut a woman\u2019s ovarian cancer risk by 40 percent \u2013 the same risk reduction provided by higher dose pills.", "about": "Educating and raising awareness of ovarian cancer and supporting those diagnosed.\nwww.Ovariancancer101.org ", "location": {"country": "United States", "street": "55 Thankful Ln", "zip": "02635", "latitude": 41.63988, "state": "MA", "city": "Cotuit", "longitude": -70.43425}, "id": "278882192167916", "phone": "(508) 827-1212"}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/YorkHospitalYorkME/", "description": "York Hospital consists of a 79-bed not-for-profit hospital, 6 community sites (in Wells, North Berwick, Berwick, South Berwick, York Village and Kittery, Maine) and 17 physician practices ranging from primary care to medical sub-specialities to surgical specialties.", "about": "York Hospital in York, Maine wants to hear from you!

Founded by Masha Banar, Board Certified Physician Associate with more than a decade of experience in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, it has been featured on ABC News for its unique alternatives to surgical procedures. \nMasha is a National Educator for Sculptra Aesthetic and teaches facial anatomy and injection techniques to Physicians and Nurses. Her extensive experience combined with artistic background and intuitive appreciation of proportions of the face brings ease to all procedures offered. Our priority is creating a very positive pleasant experience for you in the most private comfortable setting. \nNon-Surgical Facelift \nNon-Surgical Facelift allows you to achieve rested healthy appearance without taking time off your busy life. Masha uses Sculptra collagen stimulator or fillers like Radiesse, Juvederm and Restylane to gently restore youthful contour of the face, conceal depressions under the eyes, soften smile lines and marionette lines, and lift the jowls. Results last up to 2 years. \nNon-Surgical Brow Lift\nExcess skin on upper eyelids and heavy brows can be temporarily lifted with the help of Botox and Dysport. This very quick painless procedure is the most popular at any age and is often combined with treating lines of expression around the eyes, between brows, and forehead. \nNon-Surgical Rhinoplasty (Nose Job)\nThis innovative non invasive procedure made the life-long dreams of many people come true!  After numbing the area Masha injects FDA approved fillers like Radiesse or Restylane to shape and mold the nose, erase bumps, fill in divots, make the nose appear thinner, straighter, more symmetrical, attractive, and in balance with the rest of the face. Our own very unique and special procedure was featured on ABC News.\nNon-Surgical Chin and Jaw augmentation \nReceding or poorly projected chin can make the face and neck appear weak and unattractive. Chin implant can put you at higher risk of infection, numbness, and pain and non-surgical chin and jaw augmentation is a safe alternative. It can make the face more proportional and emphasize masculinity or femininity, based on the size and shape. \nNon-Surgical Jaw Reduction \nAlthough square prominent jawline can be very attractive, in some cases it can put facial features out of balance or make a woman\u2019s face too masculine.

Their physicians and lymphedema therapists recommended a compression sleeve as the most effective way of controlling the swelling. When they researched the options for the sleeve they found that the only ones available were rough textured, heavy, hot, beige, and bandage-like. Frustrated and dismayed over the lack of options they had for compression sleeves, Robin and Rachel met with Kristin Dudley, a fashion designer, to discuss their idea of creating a more elegant and comfortable compression sleeve.\n\nIn late 2007, Robin left the company. Soon after, Rachel discovered her breast cancer had returned. While she was being treated, she continued building LympheDIVAs, which brought her much joy during a difficult time in her life. Rachel died January 22, 2008, at the age of 37. Her determination and compassion to improve the lives of breast cancer survivors is very much ingrained in the spirit of LympheDIVAs.\n\nToday, LympheDIVAs\u2019 products can be found in retail locations nationwide and internationally. At Rachel\u2019s request, her father Dr. Howard Levin and her mother, Judy Levin took over the responsibility of running the company which their daughter helped found. In August of 2010, Rachel\u2019s little brother, Josh Levin, joined the company and is now running it with his parents.

Our courses are peer-reviewed, accredited, approved or endorsed by more than a dozen of the leading national health care associations.\n\nDr. Blake Andersen, CEO and founder of the HealthSciences Institute states, \u201cWe share with the National Institute of Whole Health, a vision for rigorous standards of training and practice for health care practitioners who work in a health care environment where chronic, not acute, conditions, are the main threats to health and independence. These standards are patient-centered and transcend professional disciplines and care settings. They should be based on proficiency, evidence and outcomes. They should also carry the endorsement of the healthcare industry.\u201d\n\nThe NIWH Whole Health professional programs were created to serve those who serve others in health care. NIWH is the pioneer of, Whole Health Education\u00ae, named by Union Hospital, a Harvard Affiliate Hospital, as a Best Practice in Relationship Centered Care model and was nominated by Union Hospital for the Fetzer Institute\u2019s national Best Practice in Relationship Centered Care award.\n\nWith over 35 years of research and development behind the model, clinical research still continues. In 2015, CMU has completed a Blue Cross/Blue Shield funded study on the NIWH model. In 2016, Michigan State University Medical Center will begin a registered clinical trial on the Whole Health Education Behavioral Engagement model, and its potential to transform the staggering problems healthcare faces due to poor communication between patients and providers.\n\nWhole Health Education with Behavioral Engagement places the patient at the center of their health care and empowers them, with a demystified understanding of health and disease, to take  control over their health and longevity. Whole Health Education\u00ae with Behavioral Engagement\u2122, is the first known patient education and health behavior change model developed, tested and utilized in clinical settings. The model encourages and supports both self-directed and shared decision making between patients, their physicians and care givers to create the best possible health outcomes.\n\nThe tireless work of NIWH has been recognized as important and visionary. This work includes the developed of a Whole Person Care \u2122 model of training for nurses and medical providers, as well as the Behavioral Engagement \u2122 communication skill set.\n\nIn 2005, the NIWH model became the mandate for \u201cthe practice of medicine in all settings\u201d.\nBoth the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO \u2013 now called the Joint Commission) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) identified these key guidelines, which include:\n\n> placing patients at the center of their health care decision making\n> treating the patient as a whole person\n> evidenced-based health education for prevention and disease management\n\nMedicaid/Medicare initiatives, include patient education, prevention of disease states and \u201cPay for Performance\u201d reimbursement guidelines for medical practices.\u201dPay for Performance\u201d reimbursements are based on a physician\u2019s documentation of patient education methods and disease prevention outcomes data.", "about": "The National Institute of Whole Health (NIWH) provides evidence-based, integrative whole health education for healthcare and medical professionals worldwide who desire to provide better patient care.\n\nhttp://wholehealtheducation.com", "location": {"country": "United States", "street": "148 Linden St, Ste 208a", "zip": "02482", "latitude": 42.2992287, "state": "MA", "city": "Wellesley", "longitude": -71.2939987}, "id": "10153211574972469", "phone": "(888) 354-4325"}, {"location": {"country": "United States", "street": "747 Main St, Ste 205", "zip": "01742", "latitude": 42.454986, "state": "MA", "city": "Concord", "longitude": -71.375296}, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/Dr-Greg-Symko-101022353359861/", "id": "101047036690726", "phone": "(978) 369-7070", "about": "I am one of the only providers in the Northeast area to provide Metabolic Therapy and Brain Based Neurological Therapy (BBT)."}, {"location": {"country": "United States", "street": "1223 Beacon St", "zip": "02446", "latitude": 42.34292, "state": "MA", "city": "Brookline", "longitude": -71.1167399}, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/iamwelltakencareof/", "id": "224658031231239", "phone": "(857) 800-5000", "about": "Integrative Health and Wellness Consulting "}, {"location": {"country": "United States", "street": "243 Whitney St", "zip": "01453", "latitude": 42.52942, "state": "MA", "city": "Leominster", "longitude": -71.75275}, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/kramwellness/", "id": "1563693987219774", "phone": "(877) 431-4440", "about": "KRAM Wellness Group is committed to building consumer preferred products focused on reducing injuries in youth to the elderly."}, {"link": "https://www.facebook.com/The-Advanced-Pain-Relief-Clinic-1958397527768157/", "description": "Dr. Cordima has been helping the injured and healing the sick since 1988.

I'm married and a proud mom of 3 amazing kids.  I spent the beginning of my career in the hospitality industry and worked for a hotel franchise for 15+ years.  It got to be a very hectic and demanding job which took me away from my family for days at a time.  \n\nIn 2012 I did so some soul searching and re-prioritized what was important in my life.  Being there for my kids after school and being able to help out in school was more important than a big job with a big title.  So I walked away from it all, the six figure income and all it's perks!  \n\nI wasn't quite sure what I wanted to be when I grew up, but eventually I guess you could say it found me.  I was on a business trip with my husband in CA when I walked into a retail store called bath junkie.  I knew right away this was what I wanted to do.  That was in March of 2012, I opened my store in my home town in Oct 2012.\n\nLet me tell you I probably wasn't completely prepared for what lay ahead and I went through all the trials and tribulations of setting up and running a business.  I went through good times and bad always learning and pressing on.\n\nThis past November 2015 I was starting to integrate more natural and organic products into my store which led me to discover doTERRA oils and the company itself.  It's funny how the universe has a way of aligning itself just at the right time for I truly believe that I was meant to discover essential oils through my store and begin a new chapter in my life.\n\nYes I still have my retail store but my passion has propelled me in a new direction of educatging and sharing essential oils.  I believe that my 3+ years running my retail store have prepared me to launch my new venture and I hope you'll come along with me.\n\nWhile I'm not a doctor and can't diagnose illnesses I can share my personal experiences with the oils and my knowledge of doTERRA.  It's up to you to discover how serious you are about making healthier life decisions for you and your family.
