The seeds of this partnership were planted years ago when the two were roommates at Amherst College. Jeffrey went on to medical school at New York Medical College, and later completed his residency and fellowship at Children\u2019s National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Steven received his MBA from Stanford University and became a management consultant at Bain & Company and then an officer of Kaiser Associates. Eventually, when the former roommates settled down with their young families in the same Long Island town, the vision for PM Pediatrics began to take root.\n\nAs the Director of Pediatric Emergency Medicine and Associate Chair of Emergency Medicine at New York Hospital-Queens (NYHQ), Jeffrey established a distinct emergency department for pediatric patients, grew the number of pediatric emergency visits from 10,000 per year to more than 25,000 and helped grow the entire emergency department to over 100,000 visits. During that same time period, Steven, in his role as management consultant, gained valuable experience in many different facets of the healthcare industry, including medical equipment and supplies, pharmaceuticals and healthcare delivery models. He saw firsthand how the institutional delivery of care was the weakest part of the entire healthcare system.\n\nIn his ten years at NYHQ, Jeffrey recognized that while pediatric patients get far superior medical care from physicians and nurses who are pediatric specialists, a hospital setting comes with many drawbacks in the delivery of that care. The process was inefficient and the environment can be intimidating. Children waited far too long to be seen, stayed longer than necessary and often left dissatisfied. It also was apparent that the majority of pediatric hospital visits were not for life-threatening emergencies. Rather, the problems could easily and safely be managed in an outpatient setting, provided this setting had the right clinicians and was appropriately equipped. But such places did not exist and parents had no alternative to the ER, especially when their pediatrician\u2019s office was closed.\n\nBecause of these frustrations, Jeffrey sought to learn more about the \u201cbusiness\u201d of delivering excellent care, eventually receiving an MBA from NYU Stern School of Business. He also spent many hours discussing his concerns with Steven, who at the time was Managing Director of Strategic Planning and Corporate Development at The Topps Company, Inc., where he was general manager of a successful business that he created. Steven\u2019s entrepreneurial success coupled with Jeffrey\u2019s discouragement with healthcare delivery systems provided fertile ground for that \u201caha\u201d moment: \u201cMaybe we can work together to form a business that can really make an impact on healthcare services for children.\u201d\n\nSteven had the realization that whenever his kids had a serious medical issue and their pediatrician was unavailable, Jeffrey typically provided the care in his house. The Katz family was certainly not unique \u2013 many people in Jeffrey\u2019s community sought his care in order to avoid a trip to the emergency department. This realization, along with Jeffrey\u2019s recognition that most ER visits for children were not true emergencies, made the concept of an \u201coutpatient ER\u201d for children very appealing. Over the next couple of years, the two planned the strategy and operational details of a medical service company dedicated to children and young adults, with convenient hours 365-days a year, as a legitimate alternative to the emergency department. This practice needed to be accessible, welcoming, of the highest quality, and service oriented. Every analysis pointed in the right direction and in 2005, PM Pediatrics opened the doors to its first location in Syosset, New York.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/PMPediatrics/", "id": "204251939609090"}, {"phone": "(248) 799-6884", "about": "Blue Care Network and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan are nonprofit corporations and independent licensees of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association.", "location": {"street": "20500 Civic Center Dr", "city": "Southfield", "longitude": -83.24753, "zip": "48076", "latitude": 42.48105, "country": "United States", "state": "MI"}, "description": "Blue Care Network of Michigan and its subsidiaries have more than 680,000 members.

While postural imbalances are very common, they are not ideal for your body to function properly. Your body wants to move easily through space so it can conserve energy, postural imbalances work against this.\n\nPosturology is a technique that stimulates specific areas of the body in order to activate the brain and restore optimal communication between the nervous system and the muscles. \nNeuroscientists have identified key sensory receptors responsible for the way the brain organizes posture information. For example:\n\u2022 the skin of the feet tell the brain where the body is on the ground;\n\u2022 the eye muscles telegraph the position of the head to the brain.\nWhen your feet are uneven on the ground, your body compensates creating imbalance in the rest of your body. Similarly, asymmetrical eye tracking can result in head and shoulder tilt as your brain attempts to keep the eyes on a level plane.  Sensory imbalances cause postural alignment issues, which can lead to pain symptoms and conditions, instability and weakened performance.\n\nWhat is the Posturepro International Performance Program?\nThe Posturepro International Performance Program (P.I.P.P.) is designed to provide you education in the field of Posturology. It is the most advanced evaluation and treatment system for correcting postural imbalances, improving performance and targeting pain, instability and strength. It provides practitioners with the tools and knowledge to address and prevent a wide variety of conditions. \n\nWho needs this Program?\nAny health care and/or fitness professional that is seeking to obtain long lasting results with their clients or patients can benefit from adding Posturology to their practices. Posturology can enrich your profession and improve the outcomes of treatments. \nBy bringing the body to an optimal alignment, strength increases, energy levels improve and daily performance is optimized. Strength gains up to 5.1% can be seen in elite athletes just in one consultation. \nSince Posturology targets the central nervous system, impressive results can be seen with neurological conditions, most especially in regards to stability, gait patterns and pain.\n\nWho should take the P.I.P.P.?\nThis program is designed for any practitioner that treats or manages pain associated with injuries and conditions, trains athletes, or work with clients looking to increase their strength or overall performance. \nPosturology allows the practitioner to look at the body as a whole; therefore, any practitioner that works on improving the functionality the body could benefit from incorporating Posturology techniques into their clients\u2019 protocols. \n\n\n", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/Posturepro/", "id": "2309930249020571"}, {"phone": "(904) 452-8432", "about": "Dr. Anna Cabeca, Triple Board Certified OB/GYN and Anti-Aging Medicine expert, helps women heal the 9 most dreadful symptoms of menopause with natural, safe solutions. \nCheck out 'Our Story' for more information! \u2661", "location": {"street": "119 Center Street B", "city": "Saint Simons Island", "longitude": -81.378562, "zip": "31522", "latitude": 31.1867399, "country": "United States", "state": "GA"}, "description": "We are interested in each of you obtaining optimal health and are here to help!

Empathic and in-depth discussions and debates are encouraged to learn and express mutual support for fellow readers and contributors. Everyone is welcome and encouraged to voice their opinion regardless of identity, politics, ideology, religion or agreement with other community members, the author of the post or staff members as long as those opinions are respectful and constructively add to the conversation.\n\nPDAN prides itself in providing information with a great diversity of content styles while we pay particular attention to the way the content is expressed. We summarize this by saying:\n\n\"Our key communication challenges are not so much in WHAT we say, but HOW we say it.\"\n\nPDAN IS AN INFORMATION CHANNEL, and NOT A SUPPORT GROUP:\nPDAN's Facebook pages are information and discussion channels, and not support groups. PDAN is about awareness and prevention of personality disorders. Many people in our audience are family members of people with personality disorders, and therefore they may have a very different perspective on these mental conditions than those who actually suffer from them. \n\nPDAN sometimes share content and allows comments that some people may find disturbing. If you do, please mention it to us by contacting our pages. PDAN staff will then look at the comments you find disturbing. PDAN is a volunteer-managed community. We appreciate your help in improving our pages. \n\nPDAN may not necessarily change every comment that people report as disturbing. People who are unable to see the viewpoint of family members, should look for support groups, at least as a complement of using PDAN\u2019s pages.\n\nThe same applies for family members. PDAN will sometime empathize with people who have personality disorders in ways that family members could find hard to understand. PDAN aims to create an atmosphere of radical acceptance and validation, which are two qualities we encourage you to practice personally.\n\nIf you feel you need a support group for borderline personality disorder, we recommend groups such as GroupBPD https://www.facebook.com/groups/groupbpd \nor other pages such as Borderline Personality Disorder Community https://www.facebook.com/borderline.personality.disorder.community\nor BPD Pieces of Me https://www.facebook.com/piecesofme2/\n\n\nThere are 10 defined types of Personality Disorders grouped into three clusters, and a couple of other general types of PDs.\n\nCluster A (odd or eccentric disorders)\n- Paranoid personality disorder: characterized by a pattern of irrational suspicion and mistrust of others, interpreting motivations as malevolent.\n- Schizoid personality disorder: lack of interest and detachment from social relationships, apathy, and restricted emotional expression.\n- Schizotypal personality disorder: a pattern of extreme discomfort interacting socially, and distorted cognitions and perceptions.\n\nCluster B (dramatic, emotional or erratic disorders)\n- Antisocial personality disorder: a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others, lack of empathy, bloated self-image, manipulative and impulsive behavior.\n- Borderline personality disorder: pervasive pattern of instability in relationships, self-image, identity, behavior and affects often leading to self-harm and impulsivity.\n- Histrionic personality disorder: pervasive pattern of attention-seeking behavior and excessive emotions.\n- Narcissistic personality disorder: a pervasive pattern of grandiosity, need for admiration, and a lack of empathy.\n\nCluster C (anxious or fearful disorders)\n- Avoidant personality disorder: pervasive feelings of social inhibition and inadequacy, extreme sensitivity to negative evaluation.\n- Dependent personality disorder: pervasive psychological need to be cared for by other people.\n- Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder: characterized by rigid conformity to rules, perfectionism, and control to the point of satisfaction and exclusion of leisurely activities and friendships (not the same as and quite different from obsessive-compulsive disorder).\n\nOther personality disorders (personality disturbance due to the direct effects of a medical condition.)\n- Other specified personality disorder \u2013 symptoms characteristic of a personality disorder but fails to meet the criteria for a specific disorder, with the reason given.\n- Personality disorder not otherwise specified\n\nFor information on personality disorders, please see: http://www.pdan.org/what-are-personality-disorders/ \nor http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorders\n\nFor recent medical information, please see the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM5)\nwww.dsm5.org\nor World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (WHO-ICD 10) http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F60", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/PDAN/", "id": "365642940204590"}, {"phone": "1.866.316.COPD (2673)", "about": "We're a community-based organization dedicated to improving the lives of those affected by COPD. www.copd360social.org", "location": {"city": "Washington", "longitude": -77.009896094353, "zip": "20001", "latitude": 38.896936180235, "country": "United States", "state": "DC"}, "description": "We're a community-based organization dedicated to improving the lives of those affected by COPD. www.copd360social.org", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/COPDFoundation/", "id": "10150235095059135"}, {"phone": "(718) 579-5000", "id": "709414812407361", "description": "NYC Health + Hospitals/Lincoln, formerly Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center and also known as Lincoln Hospital is a full service medical center and teaching hospital affiliated with Weill Cornell Medical College, in the South Bronx area of the Bronx, New York City.

A new hospital was built; its facilities included the latest developments in medical care. The dedication took place on April 29, 1899. The hospital became a general hospital open to all people without regard to color or creed, although it maintained its founding connection as an institution dedicated to the relief and advancement of black people.

Due to the growing population and the ever-increasing need, a committee formed to coordinate raising funds for building another hospital. The campaign took off, and the community rallied behind their efforts. Pledges from over 17,000 individuals, along with significant gifts from many organizations resulted in a successful campaign of over 3.25 million dollars to build Community Hospital Anderson.\n\nWhen the hospital first opened, it was considered a state-of-the-art facility. Over fifty years later, we are still focused on bringing the latest medical advancements to Madison County. Many of our services allow patients to stay close to home for their health care needs. Just a few examples of our advancements include our da Vinci\u00ae robotic surgical system, Clinical Research Center, neurosurgery program and our Center for Advanced Wound Healing.\n\nCommunity Hospital Anderson was built with funds raised entirely by the generous organizations and individuals in this community. It remains the only locally owned and operated hospital in Madison County. Throughout this time, we have remained steadfast in our mission to provide high quality health care here in Anderson, for the community that built us.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/CommunityAnderson/", "id": "10150161864700588"}, {"phone": "(855) 862-7763", "about": "Looking for a great doctor?

Regardless of your story, Holistic Blends has a solution that fits your needs and makes you feel phenomenal.\n\n\tSince our humble beginnings in 2007, our philosophy has centered around providing guidance toward healthier living through the use of natural supplements and remedies, nutrition, and research-based dietary guides. Our founder, Sherry Brescia, was first introduced to the field of holistic living out of necessity: For 15 years, she struggled with IBS, gas, bloating, diarrhea and constipation almost daily. She was prescribed countless medications that at times eased her pain, but mostly added a laundry list of new symptoms that required more medication. Her troubles shortly began to resolve themselves after she consulted with a holistic practitioner, who informed Sherry about the effectiveness of nutrition and natural supplements as a remedy for her digestive issues.\n\n\tWe can\u2019t promise you a one-time \u201cquick fix\u201d, but what we will consistently offer is a trusted resource for natural supplements and dietary guides that make you feel physically and mentally healthier. We have supplement bundles that provide you the best value for a combination of ailments and conditions, as well as individual products that allow you to customize your order to fit your specific needs.

Sparrow - one of Lansing's pioneer developers - donated land on East Michigan Avenue along with a gift of $100,000 to help build a new hospital. The hospital took in its first patients in 1912.

The use of natural materials and colors, peaceful garden views, cheerful natural light and soft, healing music set a soothing tone, establishing IU Health West Hospital as a place where patients can set aside stressful distractions and focus on what's important: getting well.\n\nIU Health West Hospital's team of caregivers further patients' sense of a healing sanctuary by working to build a sense of trust and rapport with patients, thereby making patients active partners in their healthcare experience, and allowing them to feel a sense of control, understanding and peace of mind.\n\nThink of every hospital experience you have had, and then push your expectations aside. IU Health West Hospital strives to exceed your expectations in every way, and provide patient care second to none.\n\nIU Health West Hospital was designed with \"on-stage\" and \"off-stage\" corridors and elevators to keep public and visitor movement through the hospital separate from the movement of patients, materials, staff and supplies. Hence, the \"day-to-day\" operations that go into running a hospital are kept out of the publicly-traveled areas, allowing for a more peaceful, serene and home-like environment.\n\nAs just one example, Emergency Servies at IU Health West features private treatment spaces and separate waiting areas for adult and pediatric emergencies. IU Health West Hospital considers patients' privacy and dignity of the utmost importance. Therefore, in Emergency Services at IU Health West you will find no curtains separating patients - exam rooms are spacious, and have actual doors shielding patients from the bustling corridors outside their treatment room.\n\nSmall waiting \"nooks\" throughout the hospital are designed to help families find cozy, private space away from the bedside for conversation and quiet time. It doesn't stop there - IU Health West Hospital's grounds feature many gardens and quiet courtyards, ponds and walking trails, perfect for conversation, relaxation and rejuvenation.\n\nIndiana University Health West Hospital does not discriminate against any person on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability or age in admission, treatment, or participation in its programs, services and activities, or in employment.

To reach their goal, they began working with the newly formed Hospital Corporation of America. Their dream became reality with the 1970 opening of Donelson Hospital.\n\nOriginally a 100-bed facility, Donelson Hospital expanded numerous times in its 21-year history to continuously meet the healthcare needs of our growing service area. The construction and 1994 opening of the new Summit Medical Center was the fruition of the founding doctors' vision. Today, the 188-bed Summit Medical Center stands as a tribute to the proud and successful history of Donelson Hospital.\n\n \nPast expansions to Summit Medical Center have included the all digital Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center. In 2005-2006, construction of the two-floor addition to Summit\u2019s Medical Office Building Three took place, which now houses additional physician offices and the fitness center. In 2008, Summit expanded its reach even further with the opening of Summit Imaging at Lebanon and Summit Convenient Care at Lebanon, located in central Wilson County. In 2010, Summit continued to expand its reach to Wilson County with the opening of Summit Walk-in Clinic and began a three phase renovation and expansion to its Emergency Department that was completed in summer 2011. \n\nSummit Medical Center is a medical and surgical facility known for emergency care, cardiac services, oncology services, orthopedic surgeries, diabetes management and obstetric services. Equally important is the emphasis that Summit places on Outpatient Services. Our facility is constructed to truly respond to the way healthcare is delivered today\u2014primarily to outpatients. Great care has been taken to ensure convenience and quality service to all patients.\n\nThe Emergency Department at Summit is ready and equipped to handle any emergency and all physicians are specially trained in Emergency Medicine. In 2003, the Emergency Department completed a major renovation increasing patient capacity by 14%. In 2011, the Emergency Department underwent a $6.3 million upgrade that included functional and aesthetic changes to enable Summit Medical Center to take care of more patients, improve patient flow and patient comfort. More than 46,000 patients were treated in Summit\u2019s Emergency Department during 2010. \n\nSummit is one of the busiest suburban maternity centers in Middle Tennessee with over 1,400 deliveries last year. We boast a Special Care Nursery with round-the-clock neonatology coverage that enables us to care for babies with special needs. Summit also offers 4D Ultrasound, the latest in ultrasound technology.\n\nSummit's Diabetes Center earned national recognition for participation in clinical trials of the MiniMed implantable insulin pump study and for a study regarding hepatic activation's role in halting diabetic kidney disease. The 20-bed Psychiatric Center meets the mental health needs of adults in our community. It is the only facility in the area with a private room for every patient.\n\nSummit's Cancer Services are a part of the Sarah Cannon Cancer Center network of the TriStar Health System. This network is the area's most comprehensive cancer program, offering the latest in research-based treatment with multiple locations in Middle Tennessee and Southern Kentucky. Cancer services at Summit currently include surgery, radiation oncology and medical oncology. In 2008, Summit was honored with the Outstanding Achievement Award by the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer for excellence in cancer treatment and care. \n\nSummit has been named one of the nation's top performing hospitals according to the 100 Top Hospitals Benchmark for Success study conducted by HCIA, Inc., and William M. Mercer, Inc. Summit expanded its Medical Imaging services with the February 2001 opening of Summit\u2019s Medical Imaging Department. The Medical Imaging Services include Radiology, CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Nuclear Medicine, a Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory and Digital Mammography. \n\nSummit Medical Center is fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.\n", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/TriStarSummit/", "id": "10155207257912801"}, {"phone": "(800) 466-3672", "about": "Delivering Homeopathic Products To Your Door Since 1853", "location": {"city": "Richford", "longitude": -72.6717, "zip": "05476", "latitude": 44.9969, "country": "United States", "state": "VT"}, "description": "Our products are 100% natural, FDA regulated, effective yet inexpensive.

His vision was to sell a unique herbal ointment which originated in the old imperial courts of China to relieve and soothe the body aches and pains of its users.\n\nLittle did he know that this remedy would transcend generations even after his death. To continue the legacy he created, his sons\u2014Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par\u2014brought Tiger Balm to Singapore in the beginning of the 20th century and soon made it a household name.\n\nSince then, Tiger Balm has grown to become one of the world's leading topical analgesics with an expanded product line that includes its traditional ointments, as wells as Tiger Liniment, Tiger Muscle Rub, Arthritis Rub, Back Pain Patches, and its new Neck and Shoulder Rub.", "location": {"latitude": 43.59771, "longitude": -79.74567}, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/TigerBalmCanada/"}, {"id": "10150171662944141", "about": "Life AFFTER Fibromyalgia - There is hope for brighter days ahead! \n\nAdvocating, Educating, Supporting, Funding Research - Hoping for a cure!", "description": "WHAT IS FIBROMYALGIA?\n\nFibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS) is chronic and affects approximately 10 million Americans, young and old.  Over half the people with FMS are unable to continue desired employment due to its debilitating nature. It is characterized by chronic and widespread body pain, fatigue, and poor sleep. A clinical diagnosis is based on those criteria, plus a history of certain symptoms which collectively represent fibromyalgia. These seemingly unrelated symptoms are described in scientific literature as Central Sensitivity Syndrome (CSS) and include: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), restless leg syndrome (RLS), temporomandibular joint pain syndrome (TMJ), regional FM or myofascial pain syndrome (MPS), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS), migraine, and sleep disorders.\n\nThe symptoms of fibromyalgia are unique for each person and vary both in intensity and frequency.  AFFTER published research* that demonstrates a significantly higher percentage of specific symptoms in the FMS group compared to a control group (gender matched without fibromyalgia), such as:  muscle pain in the neck and shoulders, muscle spasms, cramps, chest pain, changing vision, anxiety, moodiness, restlessness, hives and skin sensitivities, cognitive impairment, low grade fever, night or cold sweats, cold/heat intolerance, chronic sinusitis, dry mouth and skin, carpal tunnel pain, night driving difficulty, allergies, numbness and tingling of extremities, dizziness, pelvic pain, sensitivities to light, sound and chemicals - and the list goes on.\n\n*Fibromyalgia Patients Report Many Symptoms Other Than Pain and Fatigue (and other published studies available at: www.affter.org/research.htm)\n   \nTREATMENTS\n\nUnfortunately, there are few highly effective treatments that provide more than temporary, symptomatic relief and typically do not result in progressive improvement. Before the FDA approved Lyrica to treat FMS in 2007, there were no medications specifically approved for FMS at all. That development gave FMS validity in the eyes of the medical community and hope to FMS sufferers. Progress is being made and studies are ongoing in search of additional medications and other treatments for FMS. Being sensitive to medications, many sufferers turn to alternative therapies such as physical therapy, massage, myofascial release, acupuncture, biofeedback, trigger point injections, exercise, modifications to diet, supplements, etc. It is likely patients benefit from combinations of pharmacological and alternative treatments.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nPatients need to become educated about their disease so they can learn how to control the symptoms. AFFTER\u2019s own studies show, if the patient does their part and has a physician who is supportive and knowledgeable about FMS, they cope better. A good source for information about doctors and treatments can be from others who have fibromyalgia. A quality support group offers a safe place to exchange such information to help one cope with this illness. AFFTER runs multiple support groups, hosts seminars and fund raising/awareness events, and publishes a variety of free literature. We take an active role in educating patients and families, as well as the public and medical community.\n\nRESEARCH AND FUNDING\n\nThere is no known pathology or firm laboratory test to diagnose this syndrome and has been relatively little research funding for this illness considering the number of people it affects so profoundly. Although research progress is slow, we have learned a lot in the last decade. Abnormalities involving pain processing in the central nervous system of FMS patients has been discovered. Spinal fluid samples show an excess of neurotransmitters that transmit pain (Substance P) and deficiency of those that control pain (serotonin). This means there is an increased signal of pain with less than the normal ability to stop it.\n\nOther biological abnormalities involve dopamine, norepinephrine, tryptophan (an amino acid that is converted to serotonin), and hormone dysfunction. Growth hormone is needed by the body to repair muscles, ligaments and tendons and is produced during stage-4 sleep. People with FMS typically are deprived of this deep sleep which creates a deficiency of these important elements. There are ongoing genetic studies hoping to find a gene involved in FMS. Recent years research, using brain imaging studies utilizing functional MRI (fMRI) technology, shows abnormal pain processing in the central nervous system of people with fibromyalgia. A pain amplification process can be visualized and studied. This same fMRI technology is being used to study the cognitive symptoms of FMS (commonly referred to as fibrofog).* The search continues for a diagnostic test to confirm a diagnosis of FMS, as this may hold the key to more research funding.\n\nAFFTER is on a mission to raise funds for research for fibromyalgia. We will continue to conduct charitable activities in order to award funds to FMS researchers. The answer is in the research\u2026 only more quality research will lead to the discovery of a diagnostic laboratory test, more effective treatments, and ultimately a cure for fibromyalgia.\n\n*AFFTER has been actively involved in the study of fibrofog and other research. We recently awarded a grant for fMRI studies in an effort to put more pieces of this puzzle together.\n\n", "location": {"city": "Libertyville", "longitude": -87.922568206, "zip": "60048", "latitude": 42.2875914816, "country": "United States", "state": "IL"}, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/AFFTER.FMS/"}, {"phone": "(877) 925-3637", "about": "Yale Medicine is the clinical practice of the Yale School of Medicine.

Although he felt respected in his profession - he felt as though the agencies were missing a critical component to the staffing industry - the personal relationship with the field staff member. There wasn't an agency out there who really got to know it's staff and truly took care of their employees as if they were family. As a result, Nurses PRN and it's vision to structure a business that implemented the care and concern of a family, was born.\n\nIn 2007 PRN decided to regroup and evaluate what drives us to be the type of company that you want to work for and be associated with. Where have we come from and where are we going\u2026and, most importantly, in the midst of our day-to-day business tasks, what keeps us grounded and defines who we are as a corporation? Our discovery: at the core of everything that we do is growing relationships with all of those that we come in contact with. It was around this core concept that our mission, vision and values came to be. We hope that your experience with PRN reflects the values that we hold. We desire that your interactions with us are professional, personal and make you feel like a special part of the PRN family...\n\nOur Team works for you. Our goal is to get to know you so that we can find healthcare professionals that will meet your individual needs and that will be a good fit with your facility.  PRN is driven by our Mission, Vision and Values, they are not simply words, they are commitments we live by. They make us who we are and set us apart.

Our hospital, seven health sciences colleges, and research scientists are now under one banner. By sharing one vision, we can better provide the benefits of our research, the knowledge of our faculty physicians and the advantage of advanced technology to every patient who walks through our doors.\n\nWhy is this important? Chicago is a city with some of the best healthcare in the world. But there are communities right here, right outside our door and across our state where people aren't getting the healthcare they need. Unfortunately, health disparities - differences in the care or outcomes of patients that have nothing to do with the patients' underlying medical conditions - remain all too common. Disparities can result from many factors including lack of access to care, racial or ethnic bias (or \"institutional racism\"), and a lack of culturally appropriate communication by health care providers. National health care disparities have been extensively documented, and mechanisms for the disparities are also well known. The crying need is for solutions.\n\nChanging these disparities is a critical mission for the University of Illinois health enterprise, and we have set ambitious goals. Through patient care, education of new medical professionals, research into diseases and conditions that afflict specific populations, and elevating our presence in local communities, we will provide access to high quality, personalized health care to those who need it most.\n\nAt the same time we will continue to advance medicine at the highest levels - from nationally recognized programs in liver and kidney transplant as well as the treatment of brain aneurysms, to national centers for autism, sickle cell disease and pancreatic islet cell transplantation for the treatment of diabetes, to the management of high-risk pregnancies and the new Children's Hospital University of Illinois, we will continue to change medicine. For good. And by treating each patient as an individual, with respect for diverse cultures and unique needs for healing, we will demonstrate that we care not only for you, but also about you, helping your healing and easing your healthcare journey.\n\nWe want to be known as the best in the country at getting into communities and actually reducing disparities. Through our health sciences colleges, we will be known as the best at getting minorities into healthcare professions.

The Global Coalition Against Child Pneumonia provides leadership on these advocacy efforts and is comprised of NGOs, academic institutions, government agencies, and foundations.\n\nThe goals of Stop Pneumonia are to:\n\n1. Raise awareness about pneumonia, the world\u2019s leading infectious killer of children under the age of 5\n\n2. Promote interventions to protect against, prevent, and treat pneumonia and highlight proven approaches and solutions in need of additional resources and attention\n\n3. Generate action, including continued donor investment, to combat pneumonia and other common, yet sometimes deadly, childhood diseases\n\n\nThe initiative draws upon the contributions of advocates and health workers working to fight preventable child deaths, and highlights the impact of their efforts. We strive to educate other advocates, donors, and policy makers about the essential need for progress on pneumonia in order to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3\u2014reducing child mortality.\n\nStop Pneumonia is spearheaded by the International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC), at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Doctors Hospital was founded in Cleveland Heights by physicians of the Academy of Medicine of Cleveland. They purchased the Edgehill Apartment building at Cedar Road and Edgehill Boulevard and converted it to a hospital, which opened in August 1946. In 1968, the City of Cleveland Heights purchased and demolished the hospital for a planned parking lot and fire station. In 1966, Doctors Hospital accepted a donation of land from Cleveland developer Dominic Visconsi and ground was broken for Hillcrest Hospital. On November 23, 1968, the new Hillcrest Hospital opened for its first patients.In 1984, Hillcrest Hospital, Huron Road Hospital, Euclid Hospital, and Suburban (now South Pointe Hospital) formed the Meridia Health System, a networked hospital system. In 1997, the hospitals became part of the Cleveland Clinic Health System.In 1994, the hospital finished an expansion, increasing outpatient services and adding an on-campus medical office building. In the summer of 2005, construction was completed on the West Tower, adding 104 bed spaces, as well as two new operating rooms, an endovascular suite for minimally-invasive vascular procedures, and an expanded William B. Hirsch Cancer Center. This expanded center offers a full range of care, featuring Cleveland Clinic radiation oncologists and gynecological cancer care and treatment.

It enables the use of medicines to be significantly reduced and the sufferer's quality of life to be markedly improved. Several published clinical studies have demonstrated its excellent effectiveness and its complete safety. Cefaly has been approved by the FDA for use under prescription.\n\n- What is Cefaly?\n\nCefaly is positioned on the forehead using an adhesive electrode. Precise impulses are produced, which act on the trigeminal nerve in order to prevent migraine attacks.\n\n- Who is Cefaly for?\n\nCefaly is intended for patients who suffer from frequent migraines, especially when drugs consumption is to be reduced.\n\n- How is Cefaly used?\n\nTo use the Cefaly place a self-adhesive electrode on the forehead then position the headband on the electrode. Cefaly is operated by 2 AAA batteries of 1.5V - each battery is built into the inside of the band. A single push of the button on the front of the Cefaly activates a 20-minute session. \n\nCefay should be used once daily to reduce the frequency of the migraines. It may e used at anytime however due to its potential sedactive effect evening session are preferable.\n\n- It works!\n\nIts effectiveness is similar to migraine prevention medications. The difference is that cefaly has no side effects. Therefore, Cefaly offers the best safety-effectiveness ratio for you. \n\nIn clinical trials, 81% of compliant patients were satisfied with the Cefaly treatment. Also, the reduction in drug consumption of migraine medications in patients who responded to Cefaly was 75%.\n\n- Cefaly is perfectly safe!\n\nNo serious adverse events were reported in clinical studies. There also have been no incidents or significant side effects in any clinical studies or in the thousand of patients who've used Cefaly for several years. \n\nFor more information, please visit our website www.cefaly.us or contact us at info@cefaly.us", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/CefalyEN/", "id": "601960913157688"}, {"phone": "905 318 4724", "about": "Family friendly Dental care that is easily accessible for all modes of transportation.

There ARE symptoms, unfortunately they may be so subtle that they are attributed to other benign conditions.\n\nThe Ovarian Cancer National Alliance conducted a survey in which 89% of women were unaware of ovarian cancer symptoms before being diagnosed. However, 81% of the respondents realize in hindsight that symptoms existed before diagnosis, with these symptoms being confused with irritable bowel syndrome, pre-menopause, stress, acid reflux, endometriosis, gall bladder issues or other ailments.\nCorrect diagnoses occur only slightly more often than incorrect diagnoses. Only 59% of women are correctly diagnosed, but at least 41% of women are treated for other conditions before being diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n\nThese are scary statistics considering the advances made in early detection and pre-screening tools used to detect other forms of cancer.\n\nIt is time to BREAK THE SILENCE and educate yourself and the women you love!\n\nFACTS:\nThere are NO effective pre-screening tools for ovarian cancer and a pap smear will NOT detect it.\n\nOvarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancers in the United States and is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women.\n\nIn 2016, it is estimated that 22,980 women in the United States will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 14,270 women will die from the disease.\n\nApproximately 174,236 women living in the United States currently have ovarian cancer or have a history of ovarian cancer. Women are usually diagnosed in advanced stages and only 44% survive longer than five years. Only 19% of cases are caught before the cancer has spread beyond the ovary to the pelvic region. Despite aggressive surgical intervention and new chemotherapeutic regimens, the overall 5-year survival rate for women with advanced stage ovarian cancer has remained constant over the past 30 years, at approximately 15%. However, when ovarian cancer is detected and treated early on, the five-year survival rate is greater than 92%.\n\nSYMPTOMS:\nThe symptoms are generally subtle and vague so that women ignore them.The key is that the symptoms last more than 2-3 weeks and are otherwise unexplained. 90% of women with ovarian cancer reported having some of the following symptoms:\n\nIncreasing waist line size, for no obvious reason.\n\nDigestive problems: gas, flatulence, bloating, loss of appetite, occasionally abdominal pain.\n\nAbdominal pressure or discomfort.\n\nChanges in bowel and bladder habits (e.g. urinary frequency, diarrhea, constipation).\n\nPain (less common) in the lower back, pelvis or legs.\n\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding.\n\nUnusual fatigue or backaches.\n\nUnexplained weight loss or gain.\n\nShortness of breath.\n\nSCREENING:\nThere is no effective screening test for ovarian cancer. Screening is not recommended for all women, but is recommended for women with symptoms of ovarian cancer and women at high risk (e.g. women with a family history or women with the BRCA-1 or 2 genetic mutations). However, ovarian abnormalities can often be detected on a routine pelvic exam, with a screening vaginal ultrasound, or with a CA125. Blood levels of CA-125 are elevated in about 50% of women with early ovarian cancer and about 80% of those with advanced disease. The only way to confirm the diagnosis, however, is with an ovarian biopsy.\n\nRISK FACTORS:\nResearchers have identified certain risk factors that increase a woman\u2019s chance of developing ovarian cancer. However, studies also show that most women with these risk factors never develop the disease, while many women who do develop the disease possess no risk factors. The risk factors for ovarian cancer may include:\n\nNever having been pregnant.\n\nIncreased age.\n\nHormone replacement therapy.\n\nFamily or personal history of breast or ovarian cancer. About 7% of ovarian cancer cases have a strong hereditary component. If you have a first degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) with ovarian cancer, your risk of ovarian cancer increases to 5%; if you have 2 first degree relatives with ovarian cancer your risk becomes 7%.\n\nFamily or personal history of BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 genetic mutation. In women with BRCA 1 genetic mutations (and to a lesser extent, BRCA-2), risk of ovarian cancer is 16%\u201344%. These mutations are also associated with earlier onset of the disease. \n\nOther genetic mutations, such as Lynch Syndrome and other\u2019s just being identified.\n\nAbdominal obesity.\n\nWomen who began menstruating before age 12 or reached menopause after age 50.\n\nHaving had breast cancer, particularly before age 50.\n\nFactors that REDUCE ovarian cancer risk:\nChildbearing.\n\nBreastfeeding.\n\nTubal ligation.\n\nSurgical removal of the ovaries AND fallopian tubes.\n\nTaking birth control pills: The Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study (CASH), the largest investigation to date, found an average 40% decrease in the likelihood of ovarian cancer in women who had ever taken birth control pills. The protective effect was observed with as little as 3 to 6 months of use, and persisted for 15 years beyond discontinuation of the pill. Another study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology (8/1/00), found that oral contraceptive pills containing lower doses of estrogen and progestin also cut a woman\u2019s ovarian cancer risk by 40 percent \u2013 the same risk reduction provided by higher dose pills.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/OvarianCancer101/", "id": "278882192167916"}, {"phone": "(706) 475-7000", "id": "1670408549649986", "description": "<p><b>Piedmont Athens Regional</b> is a healthcare system located in <a href=\"/pages/w/103990676304130\">Athens, Georgia</a> that consists of an acute care hospital with 350-plus beds, four urgent care centers, a network of physicians and specialists, and a home health agency.

Founded in 1991, we were among the first of the surgical excision (LAPEX) centers implemented for dedicated, focused treatment of the disease. Since our founding, the CEC has led the way towards improved, integrated and compassionate care of endometriosis.\n\nLAPEX is a technique practiced by only the most advanced gynendoscopic surgeons in the world. The approach, while minimally invasive (Laparoscopic), facilitates successful removal of endometriosis from all affected areas and affords long term symptomatic relief, including infertility, even in advanced stages among the majority of cases. Dr. Ken Sinervo, Medical Director, along with CEC Founder Emeritus Robert B. Albee, Jr., MD, Dr. Nicholas Kongoasa, and our entire team have dedicated their lives to eradicating endometriosis, raising awareness and improving policy, facilitating research, education and support, and providing expert, patient-centered care to those struggling with the disease.\n\nThe CEC continues to serve our four founding principles:\n\n-Recognizing subtle disease in all its manifestations.\n-Removing all endometriosis, while preserving organs where and whenever possible.\n-Performing pathological examination on all excised tissue.\n-Treating those with endometriosis - and their loved ones - with respect and compassion as partners in their healthcare.\n\nIt is possible to live well in spite of endometriosis. Call, email or visit us online to learn more at CenterForEndo.com for more information. It is our honor and a blessing to try and assist all those who have, or think they may have, endometriosis from every walk of life.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/centerforendometriosiscare/", "id": "199278553444519"}, {"phone": "(703) 726-1175", "about": "Plastic Surgery, Reconstructive Surgery and Dermatology services for Northern Virginia, Loudoun and Fairfax area.", "location": {"street": "45155 Research Pl, # 125", "city": "Ashburn", "state": "VA", "zip": "20147", "located_in": "113845645313998", "latitude": 39.051605595636, "country": "United States", "longitude": -77.437729271442}, "description": "The Loudoun Center for Plastic Surgery is the premier center delivering both surgical and non-surgical cosmetic enhancements.

Since 2001 we have provided information, referral and support to Canadians involved with third party reproduction.\n\nSurrogacy in Canada is a legal, successful and wonderful alternative for those who have had difficulty creating a family on their own. A great experience depends on trust, understanding, good communication and respect for all the parties that can be involved. Intimate and emotional, this journey should be well researched and prepared for. It can be a very rewarding experience for Surrogate Mothers and is often the only option for an infertile couple to have their own genetically related child. At Surrogacy in Canada Online, we believe every person has a right to become a parent via third party reproduction regardless of their ethnic origin, religion, age, marital status, gender or sexual orientation.\n\nSurrogacy in Canada Online is owned and operated by Sally Rhoads-Heinrich, an experienced gestational surrogate mother and one of the most knowledgeable individuals in the field of third party reproduction in Canada. Sally has been involved with surrogacy in Canada since 1999 and delivered twins for an American couple in 2000. This website was originally created during the surrogacy pregnancy as a journal for the intended parents and their families to keep in touch and it has since grown into what you see today. The journal is still available for viewing, as well as photo updates of the twins as they grow up.\n\nIt is our hopes, that this site can help guide and support those who are considering (or experiencing) this family building alternative. Contact us today for an application package if you are thinking about becoming a surrogate mother or are interested in our services to assist you with your surrogacy arrangement.\n", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/surrogacycanada/", "id": "1281872991866974"}, {"phone": "(770) 634-1752", "about": "Teaching Teachers and Training Leaders.
